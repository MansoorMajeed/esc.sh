## TL;DR:

I started a new website at [selfhost.esc.sh](https://selfhost.esc.sh) for posting all Self hosting related content, powered by Ghost.

## Story

I started writing blogs on random tech stuff back in 2010 when I got my first computer (It was a Dell). I started with Blogger.com,
wrote a bunch of "trips and tricks" posts. Then I learned about WordPress and moved everything there. Got hacked several times due to my own
stupidity (such as downloading random WordPress themes) -- You live you learn

WordPress through shared website hosting back in 2013 was the era where I learned a lot about how NOT to host a website. Then came Jekyll, the static
site generator. It served me well for a long time. And finally I ended up with Hugo. This blog is currently generated using Hugo. It works great.

## Hugo - What I found lacking

I don't write much on these blogs these days. But whenever I feel the motivation to write something, I found git + text editor based flow to be cumbersome.
Don't get me wrong, as an engineer, I work with Markdown and the terminal on a daily basis and I am very comfortable with it.

### The Hugo Workflow

So here is 
open my text editor, run some scripts to create a new draft post, write stuff, copy images, link them, build it, see the local site looks good, then push to git, once the site is built and published (through cklo)
