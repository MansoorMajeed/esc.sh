title: Creating an SSD persistent volume in Google Kubernetes Engine

In my humble opinion, Google Kubernetes Engine (previously known as Google Container Engine) is the best kubernetes implementation among all the cloud providers. It is THE easiest to set up as well. Because of that, we've been using GKE extensively on many of our projects. And recently, I came across a use case that is not documented at all (at least I couldn't find any documentation) - Using an SSD with Persistent Volume (PV) in GKE

Turns out, it is not very straight forward. So, I decided to write a blog post explaining just that. 

#### Creating an SSD persistent volume in GKE
First of all, we need to add the SSD storage class so that you can start creating PVs from SSD.

Create `ssd-storage-class.yml` with the following content

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: ssd
provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd
parameters:
  type: pd-ssd
```

Create the storage class

```bash
kubectl create -f ssd-storage-class.yml
```

Once that is done, make sure that the new storage class is created and ready to use

```bash
kubectl get sc
```

You should see something like below

```bash
âžœ kubectl get sc
NAME                 TYPE
ssd                  kubernetes.io/gce-pd
standard (default)   kubernetes.io/gce-pd
```

Great. We have created the storage class. Now all we can easily create persistent volumes using the newly created storage class

#### Example: 
Create `ssd-pv-demo.yml` with the following contents

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: ssd-pv-demo
  labels:
    name: ssd-pv-demo
spec:
  accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
  storageClassName: ssd
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

the `storageClassName` is what defines whether the disk is an SSD or a standard drive. 

Alright, that's all.
