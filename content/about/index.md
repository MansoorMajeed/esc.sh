I'm Mansoor,  Site Reliability Engineer @Spotify. I like to build scalable infrastructure in the Cloud. My interests also include
tech, science, infosec, foss, travel and what have you. I sometimes write in [my tech blog](/blog). I should probably be more
consistent. I also have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@esc-sh) I am hoping to get back to this year

Here are some of the social links

* [Github](https://github.com/mansoormajeed)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mansoormajeed/)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/esc_sh)
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@esc-sh)

If you prefer to send an `email` instead, you can reach me at `m@esc.sh`

## About this site

It is a static site generated using Hugo. The source of the blog is a [public git repository](https://github.com/MansoorMajeed/esc.sh).
I use Github Actions to build and publish the site to Github Pages.

### Privacy
I don't run any ads in this site. I use Cloudflare to serve the site and use a self hosted Plausible instance to host a simple
analytics service to count the number of visitors. I don't share it with anyone (I don't even look at it myself most of the time)

If you do not wish to be tracked in any way, use Privacy Badger (which should block the Cloudflare tracker) and add `https://plaus.esc.sh/js/script.js` to your adblocker block list.
