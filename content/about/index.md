I'm Mansoor,  Site Reliability Engineer @Spotify. I like to build scalable infrastructure in the Cloud. My interests also include
tech, science, infosec, foss, travel and what have you. I sometimes write in [my tech blog](/blog). I should probably be more
consistent. I also have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@esc-sh) I am hoping to get back to this year

Here are some of the social links

* [Github](https://github.com/mansoormajeed)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mansoormajeed/)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/esc_sh)
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@esc-sh)

If you prefer to send an `email` instead, you can reach me at `m@esc.sh`

## About this site

It is a static site generated using Hugo. The source of the blog is a [public git repository](https://github.com/MansoorMajeed/esc.sh).
I use Github Actions to build and publish the site to Github Pages.

### Privacy
I don't run any ads in this site. I use Cloudflare to serve the site and use [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) to host a simple
analytics service to count the number of visitors. I don't share it with anyone (I don't know if anyone even would be interested in that :/)
I don't even look at it myself ever.

If you do not wish to be tracked in any way, use Privacy Badger (which should block the Cloudflare tracker) and add `https://sta.esc.sh/count.js` to your adblocker block list.
