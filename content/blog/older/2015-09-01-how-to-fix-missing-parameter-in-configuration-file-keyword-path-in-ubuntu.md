There is no point in talking much about it. You're probably trying to get your Ubuntu live USB to work. Let's get to the point.

If you have just created a Live USB for Ubuntu ( 14.04/14.10/15.04/15.10 ) and while booting from the USB, you're getting this error

"Missing parameter in configuration file. Keyword: path..". You have come to the right place, The fix is insanely simple.

You just press the "Tab" key, and then type "live" and then press enter. Voila, your USB should boot now. Weird huh? Well, hey it works ðŸ˜‰ I'm not sure if this issue exists with an installation of Linux Mint, anyway, this fix is worth a try.

Happy Ubuntu-ing ðŸ˜‰
