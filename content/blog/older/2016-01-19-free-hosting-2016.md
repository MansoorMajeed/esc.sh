title: Top 6 Free web hosting sites in 2016
url: blog/free-hosting-2016
---


If you wanted to create a web site or blog and you are not in a position to spend any penny on it, well, there are a couple of web hosts out there who provides web hosting for free. But let me tell you one thing, if you are serious about your web site, don't even think about a free hosting as there are shortcomings, a lot of them. Even then, if you just want to do some experimental websites or you want to learn the web hosting and stuff, you're better off with some free hosts.

Here I have made a compilation of 6 web hosts who provides web hosting for free even without any ads.

#### <a href="https://www.000webhost.com/" target="_blank">1. 000webhost</a>

They have been around for a while, and they are pretty decent.

  * 1.5GB storage
  * 100GB per month bandwidth
  * 5 addon domains
  * 5 email addresses
  * 2 MySQL databases
  * Custom control panel (No cPanel )
  * No ads

So, on the positive side, they do allow you to have 5 email accounts and 100GB bandwidth is decent. But they do not have cPanel, but another custom panel. This should not make much difference if you are new to cPanel.

#### <a href="https://www.zoho.com/sites/" target="_blank">2. Zoho Sites</a>

Zoho is great. I mean, really great. I haven't used their free web hosting service, but I do use their email hosting and it's pretty good. Considering the fact that Zoho is a big name in the industry, you can't go wrong with them. Just give it a try.

  * Unlimited storage
  * Unlimited bandwidth
  * No Ads
  * and much more.

#### <a href="https://www.freehosting.com/" target="_blank">3. FreeHosting</a>

  * No Ads
  * cPanel
  * 10 GB disk
  * 250GB bandwidth
  * No Subdomains
  * 1 FTP account
  * 1 Email account
  * 1 MySQL database

With Freehosting.com, you don't have the ability to add any subdomains. But you do get cPanel.

#### <a href="http://www.hostinger.in/" target="_blank">4. Hostinger</a>

  * 2GB disk
  * 100GB bandwidth per month
  * No Ads
  * cPanel
  * Unlimited domains
  * Email services supported

#### <a href="https://x10hosting.com/" target="_blank">5. x10hosting</a>

x10hosting has been around for a couple of years and it is quite decent. They haven't provided any "numbers" about how much you get for free. But it should be comparable to the competitors.

#### <a href="http://5gbfree.com/" target="_blank">6. 5gbFree</a>

  * 5GB Disk
  * 20GB bandwidth
  * 1 FTP account
  * 3 MySQL databases
  * 1 Addon domain
  * 1 Parked domain
  * No Ads
  * No email supported

 

Well, that's it for now. Let's see what you think of the above listed hosts in the comments. Feel free to mention hosts you think are good enough and I will update the post with them.
