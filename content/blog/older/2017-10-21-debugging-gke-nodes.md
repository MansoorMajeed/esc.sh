If you are using Kubernetes in Google Container Engine, at some point, you might have to debug from the node level (Nodes are the virtual machines where the entire cluster lives). For any debugging, you might need some additional packages, like `tcpdump` or `netstat`. The catch here is that the operating system of these hosts (CoreOS) does not have a package manager installed and you cannot install packages directly. Here is how you do it.

### Installing packages
Fortunately, installing stuff is pretty easy. Google provides a utility called `toolbox` which is located at `/usr/bin/toolbox` which gives you a shell in a debian environment. You can read more about it [HERE](https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/how-to/toolbox)

#### Installing tcpdump and netstat
SSH into to the host you want to debug. I will use `gcloud` to ssh into the VM
Don't forget to replace the name of the instance, region and the project name
```
gcloud compute ssh gke-dev-cluster-default-pool-53b7e787-580g --zone asia-southeast1-a â€”project=yourproject
```
Once logged in, switch to root
```
sudo su -
```
Invoke the `toolbox`. Just enter the below and press enter.  
```
/usr/bin/toolbox
```
This will pull a docker image and launch a container for you. You should see something like below
```
gke-dev-cluster-default-pool-53b7e787-580g ~ # toolbox

```
Now you are presented with a SHELL in a debian container. You can install whatever package you want. Let's install `tcpdump` and `netstat`
```
apt-get update
apt-get install tcpdump net-tools
```
Done! You're good to go. You should be able to use this environment to do any kind of debugging just as you would do on a normal debian VM
