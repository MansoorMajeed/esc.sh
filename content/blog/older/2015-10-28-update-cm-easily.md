I love CyanogenMod, so does manyÂ people. But, since it is maintained by the community, most of the devices out there have what's known as "Nightly build". Meaning, the ROM maintainer will release updates on a daily basis. Now, these files are around 300 megabytes. It will be difficult to download the full ROM every day and flash it. This is both time consuming and can take a lot of data. Today, I'll show you guys how to update your CyanogenMod ROM without downloading the full 300 MB zip file

Meet CyanDelta, an awesome app that lets you download the updated only, not the full ROM and the update is usually under 20 MB. Sounds cool, right? And it works just great. I have been personally using the APP and never faced any issue so far.

### How To update your CM nightly build using CyanDelta

  1. Download the APP to your device, fromÂ <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyandelta&hl=en" target="_blank">HERE</a>
  2. Open the APP and you will be asked to choose the ZIP on your device. This is the full zip file you used to install the ROM. That is, the 250MB zip file ( Ex: cm-12.1-20151023-NIGHTLY-otus.zip ). If you're not able to access the SD card from the app, copy the zip file to the internal memory and choose it from there.
  3. Now the APP will show you if there is an update for the build, and if there is any update, it will show you under "Available update"
  4. Tap on it, and the update will be downloaded to your phone. Once the download is completed, follow the instructions in the screen and you should be able to update the build without any issues

That's all..!! ðŸ™‚
